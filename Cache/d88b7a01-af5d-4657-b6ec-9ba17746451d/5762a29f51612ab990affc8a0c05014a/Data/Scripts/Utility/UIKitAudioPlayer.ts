 *
 * Each AudioComponent is created once for a given track and never has its
 * `audioTrack` reassigned, so the underlying audio-service playback stream (the
 * "pusher") stays stable across plays and the service's SubmixSrcNodePool can
 * reuse a pooled node instead of creating a dynamic node on every interaction.
 *
 * Voice selection is a plain round-robin: ramp up to MAX_VOICES_PER_TRACK fresh
 * voices, then cycle through them. Consecutive plays therefore land on
 * *different* voices, so overlapping pokes (fast typing) are actually audible
 * up to the cap. We intentionally do NOT try to pick an "idle" voice via
 * `isPlaying()` — a stream starts asynchronously, so `isPlaying()` reports false
 * for a short window after `play()`, which made rapid plays collapse onto a
 * single voice (monophonic, no overlap).
